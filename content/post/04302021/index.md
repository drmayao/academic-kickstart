Our project on Real-time data monitoring System with Nanorobotics has been selected in [National Science Foundation (NSF) Regional I-Corps Site Program](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/research/research-park/prototype-build/nsf-icorps.php) supported by Texas Tech University Innovation Hub at Research Park.

The Innovation Hub’s programs support three distinct areas to further develop science and ideas to form high impact technology teams and launch successful startups. The Texas Tech’s I-Corps Site nurtures and supports teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. we are thrilled to participate in this prestigious program to learn the NSF I-Corps approach, including validation of the business model and product-market fit. We will spend time talking to customers, partners, and competitors, and testing hypotheses. At the conclusion of the program, we will present our findings from customer discovery and receive feedback from the NSF I-Corps teaching team.

We appreciate the funding support from the program very much!
