Ph.D. student Mehmet Ozkan at MALab received ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division Rising Star Award for our work entitled [Socially Compatible Control Design of Automated Vehicle in Mixed Traffic](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9638989) during the **2022 Modeling, Estimation, and Control Conference (MECC 2022)**. We also presented our recent paper [Inverse Resource Rational Based Stochastic Driver Behavior Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07088) at the conference. Congratulations!
