MALab participated in the 2022 Texas Tech University [Explore Engineering Summer Camp](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/coe/undergraduate/explore/) hosted by Whitacre College of Engineering. We were delighted to welcome 37 high school students with a short course on autonomous mobile robots, led by MALab Ph.D. candidate [Mehmet Ozkan](https://www.ma-yao.com/authors/mehmet/). Students assembled, programmed and raced scaled robotic cars and had a lot fun! We were particularly glad to receive a lot interests from students in pursuing post secondary education in the field of autonomous systems and robots, as we had hoped to achieve through such outreach activities, supported by National Science Foundation project [CRII: CPS: Human-Centric Connected and Automated Vehicles for Sustainable Mobility](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2153229&HistoricalAwards=false).
