Our recent proposal has been funded by Alternate Energy Research Initiative from College of Engineering.
This project focuses on improving the energy efficiency and reducing emissions of the automotive and transportation systems through modeling, control, and optimization of ground vehicles powered by traditional fossil fuel, battery, and combinations of other alternative energy sources.
