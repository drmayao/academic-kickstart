Welcome to the Mobility Automation Lab (MALAB) at Texas Tech University Whitacre College of Engineering. Our research interests focus on developing control and modeling methods for a wide range of autonomous mobility systems. Current topics include: Connected and autonomous vehicle systems control for energy consumption and emission reductions; Intelligent Vehicle-Traffic Systems; Advanced Diesel Aftertreatment System Modeling, Controls, and Diagnostics; Integrated Powertrain and Aftertreatment System Control for Clean Vehicles.

Yao Ma joined the department of mechanical engineering at Texas Tech University as a tenure-track assistant professor in August, 2019. Before he joined TTU, he graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering in May, 2019. He was trained in [**Mobility Systems Laboratory**](http://sites.utexas.edu/msl/) led by Prof. Junmin Wang.
